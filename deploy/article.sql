It also presents strong proof that China and the United States, despite their differences, are capable of addressing their problems based on the principles of equality and mutual respect.\n\nNo one wins in a trade war; it is just a matter of who loses more or less. Over the past 18 months, it has been U.S. businesses, farmers and consumers who have been bearing the brunt of Washington\'s tariff tantrum.\n\nData from the U.S. Commerce Department shows that U.S. consumers and businesses paid an additional 42 billion U.S. dollars from February 2018 through October 2019 as a result of the trade disputes. Moreover, in the first seven months of 2019, U.S. goods exports to China declined 18.2 percent, while imports were down 12.3 percent.\n\nThe very reason that two-way trade surged by roughly 252 times from 2.5 billion dollars in 1979 to 633.5 billion dollars in 2018 is that it is astronomically beneficial to both sides. A report published by the Brookings Institution in February 2018 noted that \"U.S. exports to China support around 1.8 million jobs in sectors such as services, agriculture, and capital goods.\"\n\nAs the two countries set out to implement the phase-one deal, huge potential in bilateral trade is waiting to be tapped.\n\nChina is currently restructuring its economy and pursuing a quality-oriented growth pattern. It has also been rolling out a raft of measures to level the domestic playing field. For foreign entrepreneurs, U.S. investors included, a more open Chinese economy means more attractive and profitable business opportunities.\n\nFor the global community, a vibrant China-U.S. trade relationship will also contribute to global stability and prosperity. As International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva recently commented, the China-U.S. phase-one trade deal will reduce the uncertainty that has impeded global economic growth, despite the depressing fact that, according to the IMF\'s calculation, the cumulative effect of the trade conflict could mean a loss of 0.8 percent of global gross domestic product, or around 700 billion dollars, by 2020.\n\nIn the next stage, to achieve an early and complete resolution of the trade issue, the two countries need to implement in good faith the trade pact as well as other important consensuses Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump have reached on different occasions, so as to inject stability into the world economy during this uncertain time.\n\nCurrently, China is going all out in its fight against the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, and has received donations from many sectors in the United States.\n\nThis epidemic is a sobering reminder that mankind faces no shortage of unexpected common challenges, and that cooperation is urgently needed among members of the international community.\n\nChina and the United States, as two major countries on the world stage, shoulder a special responsibility to jointly nurture their economic partnership and help solve the world\'s most pressing priorities, such as climate change and other issues concerning the future wellbeing of humanity.\n\n\"What a culmination if, forty years later, the United States and China could merge their efforts not to shake the world, but to build it,\" wrote Henry Kissinger, a former U.S. secretary of state and pioneer in renormalizing China-U.S. relations, in his book \"On China.\"\n\nThe first 40 years since Beijing and Washington officially established diplomatic ties on Jan. 1, 1979 demonstrated that when the two countries work together, they can do great good for their people and the world as a whole.\n\nAs what is arguably the most important bilateral relationship in today\'s world marches into the second 40 years, the two countries have in their hands an ample chance to do even greater good for all.',369457720),(243,'123',1,'Spokesperson urges U.S. politicians to stop smearing China','2020-02-15 18:20:50','2020-02-15 18:20:50','BEIJING, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Friday refuted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\'s allegations of \"Chinese infiltration in the U.S.\", noting that the remarks were awash with Cold-War mentality and political prejudice.\n\nSpokesperson Geng Shuang made the comments when responding to reports that said Pompeo once again talked about Chinese infiltration in the United States during a recent interview.\n\nGeng told an online news briefing that China has always adhered to the principle of non-interference in other countries\' internal affairs. \"China\'s diplomatic missions and civil groups in the U.S. observe international laws and bilateral agreements.

steel and aluminum imports by 25 percent and 10 percent respectively took effect on Saturday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed a proclamation two weeks ago to raise tariffs on derivative steel and aluminum imports to cover nails, staples and other downstream products, calling it \"necessary and appropriate.\"\n\nForeign producers of these derivative articles have increased shipments of such articles to the United States to \"circumvent\" the existing duties on steel and aluminum imports, threatening to undermine the administration\'s actions to address the national security risks, said the president.\n\nArgentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea are exempt from the additional tariffs on derivative steel products, while Argentina, Australia, Canada and Mexico are exempt from the additional duties on derivative aluminum products, according to the proclamation.\n\nEconomists have long argued that such tariffs have hurt the American manufacturing sector and the overall economy, and the latest move has provoked further criticism.\n\n\"This latest action was significant because, explicitly for the first time, Trump was imposing new tariffs to help an industry suffering because of his previous tariffs,\" wrote Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nIn 2018, the Trump administration unilaterally imposed a 25-percent tariff on steel imports and 10-percent tariff on aluminum imports citing national security concerns, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\n\nAccording to a research by Trade Partnership Worldwide, LLC, an international trade and economic consulting firm, higher costs from steel and aluminum tariffs, quotas and associated retaliation by trading partners would reduce U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.2 percent annually.\n\nThe research also showed that 16 jobs would be lost in other U.S. sectors for every job gained in the steel or aluminum sector, and every U.S. state will experience a net loss of jobs due to the tariffs.\n\nTrump\'s new method of extending his steel and aluminum tariffs raises a host of worries, including the \"increased uncertainty\" that companies face in light of the administration\'s approach to trade policy, Bown said.\n\n\"With each round of cascading tariffs, Trump has bullied more American companies into becoming protectionist,\" Bown argued. \"For many Americans, the higher costs resulting from his tariffs mean they can no longer compete with foreign firms in either the U.S. or global market.\"\n\nThe \"Tariff Man\" has imposed policies that are changing both the economy and America\'s political economy of protectionism, he said. \"The worst may be yet to

18:24:23','2020-02-15 18:24:23','LONDON, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government has started developing the country\'s new tariff regime for imports after the Brexit transition period, which ends in December this year.\n\nIt is the latest effort by the British government to shape its post-Brexit trade policy. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain will seek a Canada-style trade agreement with the European Union (EU) as part of its future trade relationship with the bloc, and diverge from EU rules.\n\nThe new tariff regime, known as the UK Global Tariff, will come into effect on Jan. 1, 2021 for imports from any country that Britain does not have a free trade agreement with. The Department for International Trade on Thursday launched a four-week public consultation, seeking views on simplifying and tailoring the tariff to suit British businesses and households, such as removing tariffs of less than 2.5 percent and rounding tariffs down to the nearest 2.5 percent, 5 percent or 10 percent band.\n\nOther contents for consultation include removing tariffs on key inputs to production which could reduce costs for British manufacturers, and removing tariffs where the Britain has zero or limited domestic production which could help to lower prices for consumers.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: \"The UK has left the EU and it is time for us to look forward to our future as an independent, global champion of free trade...It is vitally important that we now move away from complex tariff schedule imposed on us by the European Union.\"\n\nIn Johnson\'s vision for Britain\'s post-Brexit trade relations, the country will be unshackled after 47 years tied to the EU.\n\n\"We have so often been told that we must choose between full access to the EU market, along with accepting its rules and courts on the Norway model, or a free trade agreement, which opens up markets and avoids the full panoply of EU regulation, like the Canada deal,\" Johnson said earlier this week in a speech to business leaders in London.\n\n\"We want a comprehensive free trade agreement, similar to Canada\'s. But in the very unlikely event that we do not succeed, then our trade will have to be based on our existing Withdrawal Agreement with the EU,\" he said.\n\nThe prime minister said the choice for Britain is emphatically not a case of \"deal or no deal\", the question is whether Britain agrees a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada\'s -- or more like Australia\'s.\n\n\"And I have no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper,\" he said.\n\nCanada and the EU signed in 2016 the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement after seven years of negotiation. It is regarded as the most ambitious trade agreement that the EU has ever concluded with non-EU countries.

This allowed Chinese to leapfrog over legacy tech to the rapid adoption of mobile and smart phones.\n\nMeanwhile, China\'s underdeveloped brick and mortar retail industry in the 1990s and 2000s also allowed for the preferential adoption of online shopping, which paved the way for the rapid growth of e-commerce and the rise of online retail giants like Alibaba, he said.\n\nChina had a cash-based payment system with low credit card penetration, so there were few barriers to the adoption of mobile payments, according to Weisblum. This has allowed for the rapid development of a robust Chinese internet and super-apps like WeChat, which exceeds the functionality of American apps and provided more interactive opportunity for retailers to customers.\n\n\"Think of all the apps we use on a daily basis, like Apple Pay, YouTube, Uber, Instant messaging, etc., WeChat has the ability to do all that and more within one app,\" Wisebaum explained to hundreds of audience members, WeChat functionality includes text messaging, document exchange, mobile payments, photo-sharing, video-sharing, social media, language translation, and is linked to food delivery services, rideshare services.\n\n\"It is the app of choice for virtually all Chinese and enjoys 1.2 billion active users monthly worldwide,\" he said, as his words made many audience members\' eyebrows rise.\n\nWeisblum also noted that U.S. retailers\' pain points were customer personalization, customer profiling and analytics, all areas in which China excels.\n\nSharing the vast amounts of user data generated and captured in China resulted in much more user feedback, faster product iterations and the rapid development of a far more personalized user experience.\n\nHe contended that U.S. retailers can learn a lot from China\'s robust integration of AI and analytics into their retail industry, driving local e-commerce industry, enhancing customer engagement, and improving the personalization of the customer experience.\n\n\"China is emerging in a leadership position in AI,\" he told Xinhua. \"Having that much personal info on their users can drive the personalization consumer experience.\"\n\nHe emphasized that WeChat, Taobao, Weibo, Douyin, JD.com\'s \"Boundaryless Retail\", and many others are reshaping the online and e-commerce landscape in China and the world in innovative and forward-looking ways.\n\n\"Look at Alibaba\'s Freshippo infusing offline retail with technology, so their customers can buy online and pick up in store locally. It gives the customer the ability to have the shopping experience they want,\" Weisblum affirmed, \"JD.com\'s \'Boundaryless Retail\' as omnichannel retailing also merges online and offline.\"\n\nWeisblum also pointed out that China embraces consumer culture in other innovative ways, for instance by recognizing \"Shopping Festivals\" virtually every month, such as Singles Day on November 11, the largest single shopping event in the world.\n\n\"The number of opportunities for Chinese retailers to interact with their customers is exponentially higher than it is in the West.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will cancel a planned trip to the Middle East initially planned from Saturday amid the escalating tensions in the region, government sources said Wednesday.\n\nThe Japanese leader was planning to visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman to explain and try to garner further understanding of Japan\'s contentious plan to dispatch Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) personnel and hardware to the region.\n\nThe cancellation of Abe\'s trip comes amid a missile attack carried out by Iran on Iraqi bases hosting U.S. and coalition forces, with the strike believed to be a reprisal for the United States carrying out an airstrike last week which killed a top Iranian general, the sources said.\n\nWhile the prime minister\'s trip will be cancelled, the government here said Wednesday that it still plans to dispatch an MSDF destroyer to the region in early February and patrol planes later this month, according to Japan\'s top government spokesperson Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.\n\nIn late December, the Japanese Cabinet approved the dispatch of MSDF forces to the Middle East, despite political and public opposition to the move amid concerns over post-war military constraints restricting the nation\'s military activities constitutionally.\n\nThe planned deployment is to purportedly conduct \"information-gathering\" operations and others related to enhancing the safety of commercial shipping in the region, a key region for oil to reach resource-poor Japan.\n\nTwo P-3C patrol planes and a helicopter-carrying destroyer will be sent to the Middle East, along with around 260 MSDF personnel, to engage in a one-year survey and research mission, according to the government\'s plan.\n\nBoth opposition lawmakers and the public are opposed to the move, with Jun Azumi, the Diet affairs chief of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan calling on the government to scrap the highly divisive and contentious plan, in light of the latest escalation in tensions that could henceforth see the region become a potential war zone.\n\nAzumi told reporters that the planned deployment should now be cancelled, calling the move preposterous under the current circumstances.\n\n\"It would be inconceivable to send troops amid heightened tensions,\" Azumi said, a sentiment backed by other opposition parties and the public,

Going forward, sufficient funds must be set aside in all construction projects to ensure that wage payments to migrant workers are made on time and in keeping with the contractual terms.\n\nIn particular, no government departments, SOEs or public institutions should, for whatever reason, owe migrant workers wages.\n\nThe SOEs will be urged to strengthen internal discipline for meeting payments on time, make the control and clearing of due payments part of their internal evaluation. No repayments shall be made in commercial bills or other non-monetary forms without the consent of the recipients.\n\nThe meeting also required the issuing of a regulation regarding timely payments to small and medium-sized enterprises. Governments at all levels must tighten their belts, practice frugality and live within their means. No government-invested project without solid funding will be approved. Irregularities such as implementing projects outside the budget plan, starting construction before getting approval, or asking construction entities to make advance payments, will be seriously dealt with.\n\n\"We must establish a long-term mechanism to prevent arrears by government departments and SOEs.

The steady development of China-Myanmar ties is a demonstration of how to follow the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in others\' internal affairs, mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.\n\nIn recent years, China has maintained good momentum for high-level contact and consolidated political mutual trust with the Southeast Asian country.

In 2016, soon after taking office as Myanmar\'s state counselor, Aung San Suu Kyi chose China as the first country to visit outside the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nBeing economically complementary, China has become Myanmar\'s largest trading partner and important source of foreign investment, as bilateral economic and trade cooperation continue to deepen.\n\nA top priority for the Myanmar government is to drive economic growth and improve people\'s well-being. China is more than willing to share its experience and know-how in combating poverty and building infrastructure, in an effort to promote win-win cooperation and seek common development with its neighbors.\n\nThe two neighbors are actively facilitating mutually beneficial projects, including oil and gas pipelines, port construction within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, and accelerating the development of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor.\n\nIt is in the fundamental interests of both countries to enhance China-Myanmar brotherly bonds and seek practical cooperation, which in turn will contribute to building a shared future in the Asia-Pacific region.

Among them, the United States has raised its travel advisory for China to the highest level and has temporarily banned all foreigners who have traveled to China in the past 14 days from Feb. 2.\n\nActing with a high sense of responsibility to people\'s health, the Chinese government has taken the most comprehensive and strict prevention and control measures after the outbreak of the epidemic, many of which have far exceeded what International Health Regulations required, said Hua.\n\nHua quoted the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as saying, China is setting a new standard for outbreak response. In the same speech, he said explicitly that declaring a public health emergency of international concern is not a vote of no confidence in China. On the contrary, the WHO continues to have confidence in China\'s capacity to control the outbreak. There is no reason to take unnecessary measures restricting international travel and trade.\n\nNoting most countries appreciate and support China\'s efforts to fight the novel coronavirus, Hua said China understands and respects them when they adopt or enhance quarantine measures at border entries. \"But in the meantime, some countries, in particular the United States, have inappropriately overreacted, which certainly runs counter to WHO advice.\"\n\n\"The U.S. government hasn\'t provided any substantial assistance to us, but it was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a comprehensive travel ban on Chinese travelers. (The U.S. actions) could only create and spread fear, setting a bad example for others,\" said the spokesperson.\n\nHua said even U.S. media and experts doubted the government\'s decision. They said that the U.S. government\'s restrictions on China are precisely what the WHO rejects, that the United States is turning from overconfidence to fear and overreaction, and that banning the entry of foreigners who traveled to China in the past 14 days is suspected of infringing on civil rights rather than reducing risks of virus spreading, according to Hua.\n\nHua cited a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as saying that the flu from 2019-2020 season has caused 19 million infection cases and at least 10,000 deaths in the United States. By contrast, by Feb. 2, 17,205 cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection had been confirmed in China with 361 deaths, and 475 patients had been cured, while there are only 11 confirmed cases in the United States.\n\n\"The contrast is thought-provoking,\" Hua said.\n\nShe pointed out that the Canadian minister of health said Canada would not follow the U.S. to impose travel restrictions on Chinese or foreign nationals who had been to China, which was baseless. \"It is a sharp contrast to the U.S. behaviors,\" Hua said.\n\nNoting that the destinies of all countries are closely linked in a globalized world, Hua said in the face of a public health crisis, countries should work together to overcome the difficulties, rather than resort to beggar-thy-neighbor practice, let alone take advantage of others\' difficulties.\n\nAccording to Hua, since Jan. 3, the Chinese side has notified the United States of the epidemic and China\'s control measures altogether 30 times.

sports, drive economy and trade, and make their positive contribution to world peace and development, he added.\n\nOn counterterrorism efforts, Zhang noted at present, terrorism remains a serious

extremism, and maintain world peace and tranquility.\n\nBefore Zhang spoke, Vladimir Voronkov, undersecretary-general of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT), said sports events, especially those in which international famous athletes participate, have been for a long time a preferred terrorist target.\n\nHe emphasized that protecting major sporting events entails multilevel cooperation and coordination, as well as complex security and policing arrangements, including securing locations, cybersecurity, crisis planning and management, and strategic communication.\n\nLed by UNOCT, the

-- The rejection of Arab states of the recently-proposed U.S. peace plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict eliminates chances for the plan\'s implementation, said Palestinian and Egyptian experts.\n\nIn an emergency meeting at the Arab League (AL) headquarters in Cairo on Saturday, Arab foreign ministers unanimously agreed to boycott the U.S. plan, also known as the \"Deal of the Century,\" and not to cooperate \"in any way\" with Washington in its implementation.\n\nThe final statement of the Arab meeting described as \"unfair\" the peace deal, announced on Jan. 28 by U.S. President Donald Trump, in the presence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"The U.S. deal was born dead, as it does not respond to the minimum aspirations of the Palestinian people in the establishment of their independent state based on the pre-1967 borders,\" said Barakat al-Farra, former Palestinian ambassador to Cairo and former Palestinian representative at the AL.\n\nAl-Farra stressed that the Arab consensus on rejecting the U.S. deal \"eliminates any chance for its success,\" adding that the deal violates international legitimacy resolutions and it leads to neither peace nor stability in the Middle East region.\n\n\"Arabs opposed the deal for objective reasons, especially that it represents a U.S.-Israeli plan to take the issue away from the UNSC (United Nations Security Council),\" the Palestinian ex-diplomat told Xinhua, describing the deal as \"biased to Israel.\"\n\nAl-Farra said that if Israel implements the deal unilaterally, it will be an illegitimate act without legal basis and so it will be rejected by the UN.\n\nMokhtar Ghobashi, deputy chairman of the Cairo-based Arab Center for Political and Strategic Studies, said that the Arab rejection of the U.S. deal is not enough unless it involves mechanisms to pressure the United States and Israel to give it up.\n\n\"The Israeli side has the green light from Washington to implement the deal and Trump has told the Palestinians that they have four years to  it,\" said the Egyptian political expert.\n\nHe added that relying on UN resolutions is insufficient because they have been disregarded when the United States relocated its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nDuring the AL meeting on Saturday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that the U.S. deal is \"completely rejected once they announced annexing Jerusalem to Israel,\" vowing to cut ties with Israel and the United States over the deal.\n\nThe United States, Israel\'s main backer, officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital in late 2017 and relocated the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the holy city in May 2018.\n\nWhile Jerusalem is to be Israel\'s \"undivided capital,\" the Palestinian capital will include areas on the outskirts of East Jerusalem, according to the U.S. vision on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\n\nTarek Fahmy, a political science professor at Cairo University, emphasized that \"the U.S. deal shows persistence on legalizing Israeli settlement construction on Palestinian occupied territories, which is the most dangerous thing that could happen.\"\n\nAlong with Trump and Netanyahu, diplomats from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman attended the announcement of the U.S. deal at the White House in late January.\n\n\"Washington tries to cause and invest a kind of division in the Arab world while luring some regional and international parties to support the deal,\" the political science professor told Xinhua.\n\nFahmy described the Arab rejection of the U.S. Mideast peace plan as \"a good stance\" that shows a united Arab position in support of the Palestinian cause.\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict erupted following the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the Western-backed creation of Israel in 1948.\n\n\"The Palestinian plan to raise the issue at the UN and other organizations such as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the African Union is a good thing but it needs further practical mechanisms,\" Fahmy said.\n\nHe predicted that Trump\'s administration would attempt to ruin the Palestinian efforts and use the veto right against any future UN resolution in favor of the Palestinians.\n\nThe plan states that \"the State of Palestine shall be fully demilitarized and

We hope to carry the momentum to Tokyo 2020,\" the 36-year-old said.\n\n\"As for the women\'s saber team, there\'s not a world champion yet, but we\'ve got some talents that have frequent podium finishes in international tournaments and we are steadily improving.

It was 10 years ago that the half-time champion, called the \"Herbstmeister\" (or autumn champion), was not Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund.\n\nWith league leader RB Leipzig and runner-up Borussia Moenchengladbach, the established forces face serious challengers. But there are many more surprises.\n\nSURPRISES\n\nLeipzig: 32-year-old Julian Nagelsmann lifted RB Leipzig on a new level. The first qualification for the knock-out stage in the club\'s history and the chance to win the first national title are setting new marks for the East-German side.\n\nMental robustness comes along with the best figure of 48 goals (2.82 on average). Rasenballsport is the trendsetting side with 11 goals after counter-attacks, 13 after dead-ball situations, and 20 points out of nine away-games (all league-best marks).\n\nThe youngest coach has added a finely adjusted ball-possession note to the team\'s convincing forwarding football.\n\nChance to win the title: high.\n\nMoenchengladbach: The famous \"foals\" are back on the big stage thanks to the enchanting style implemented by new coach Marco Rose. The best side on home soil (22 points) has played the best first season half since 1976/77.\n\nThe five-time German champion stands for the best defense (18 goals) aside from Wolfsburg (9). Failing to secure the next round in the Euro League and the German Cup might increase the chances to win the first Championship since 1977 as the team can entirely focus on the title-race.\n\nChance to win the title: relatively high.\n\nSC Freiburg: One of the smallest clubs can count on a calm environment and a coach who is said to be the league\'s most passionate manager, Christian Streich.\n\nAside from Streichs demands for a high standard regarding running figures has the side from Germany\'s South-West increased its squad\'s quality.\n\nChance to win the title: To reach an international competition seems the upmost. That is no problem as no one is talking about the title.\n\nDISAPPOINTMENT\n\nFrankfurt: The team that reached the Euro League semifinal (5-4 against Chelsea in aggregate) a year ago seems to run out of breath after seven games without a victory before the winter break.\n\nEintracht has reached its limits as Austrian coach Adi Huetter is admitting: \"We are done for now and need to recover.\"\n\nOnly one victory in eight away-games might tell the story of an exhausted team that seems out of balance.

The Blacks and Yellows expressed goal after last season\'s second place was to win the title.\n\nThe team\'s inconsistency remains the biggest problem. Coach Lucien Favre remains under fire and failed to do the next step. Having skipped plans to sign a true spearhead turns out to be a fatal mistake.\n\nThe poor record in away-games (3 wins) is far from expectations for the only unbeaten team on home soil (5/3).\n\nOVER PERFORMING\n\nUnion: The newcomer might still be in danger of being relegated with 20 points after 17 games. Considering the passion (despite the small budget) the team of Swiss coach Urs Fischer has to give, the \"team of iron\" is more than a pleasant surprise.\n\nTo never give up seems the club\'s motto. Times might be hard for Union it says in the club\'s hymn, \"but so is the team.\"\n\nSchalke: The Royal Blues enjoy a surprising upswing under former Huddersfield hero David Wagner. Schalke\'s performance seems far from spectacular, but the 48-year-old has managed to lead the fragile side back to stability.\n\nIt remains a challenge to deal with their number one\'s announcement to join Bayern for the next season. Alexanders Nuebel\'s decision is causing turmoil among supporters. The 23-year-old might leave in the winter-break.\n\nIN DANGER\n\nPaderborn: It might deserve respect to stick to a risky forwarding football after promoting to the Bundesliga. But 12 points at half-time don\'t seem enough to secure the first division for the newcomer.\n\nBremen: Werder is the biggest disappointment as coach Florian Kohfeldt couldn\'t manage to lead the struggling side to the next level. Instead of reaching an international competition, a fierce battle against relegation is ahead.\n\nSTILL ALIVE\n\nCologne: The newcomer enjoys a surprising upswing with three wins in the last three games. With coach Markus Gisdol the \"FC\" has discovered its fighting heart but still has to travel over a bumpy road.\n\nHertha: Juergen Klinsmann is doing small but significant steps. Stability was the former German national coach\'s main goal. Plans to create a \"big city club\" are waiting. Things seem to work out well.\n\nBayern: Never forget about the particular Bavarian DNA. Having changed the coach from Niko Kovac to Hansi Flick was the right decision.

In December 2019, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reaffirmed Hong Kong\'s position as a global financial center and regional trading hub, and one of the most open economies in the world.\n\nThe chief executive spoke highly of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, saying the Greater Bay Area, with a population of about 70 million and a combined GDP equivalent of around 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars, and its huge market potential, presented boundless promise for Hong Kong, particularly the financial services sector.\n\n\"Coupled with the Belt and Road Initiative, the Greater Bay Area development will ensure long-term prospects for Hong Kong\'s economy,\" she said, adding that through the two national policies, Hong Kong will enhance its role as a business bridge between the Chinese mainland and the rest of the world.\n\nLam said she is \"confident that we will bridge our divide, (and) that we will realize the common goal of a re-united community and a flourishing economy\" through the concerted efforts of the HKSAR government and the people of Hong Kong.\n\nEchoing her opinion, Paul Chan, financial secretary of the HKSAR government, said, \"We will also step up efforts to capitalize on emerging opportunities -- not only from green finance and Fintech, but (also) from the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative.\"\n\n\"Hong Kong is, and will remain, the business bridge between the mainland and the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nChan added that green finance is the policy priority going forward, and financial technology is another area that Hong Kong is striving to excel.

Overall, on this windy day, the greens are fast so I am happy with an under-par round,” said the 23-year-old who last won in 2015.\n\n“To be honest, I haven’t been in the lead for a long time and it was obvious to see that I was a bit nervous on the last hole, but that’s common. I guess everybody else is going to be nervous as well. All I can do is just deal with it tomorrow, be aggressive and try to get the best out of it.”\n\nKanphanitnan posted her best result of the week when the 20-year-old carded a round featuring four birdies and two bogeys.\n\n“I don’t think about tomorrow. I just want to be better as much as I can. For this round I was really good with my approach shots,” said the Khonkaen native who finished 10th on the Symetra Tour money list this year to earn her full playing card for the 2020 US LPGA Tour season.\n\nAlso looking to be better is Liu Yan, the runner-up at last year’s Women’s China Open. “Being three shots behind is not so large out there. You should believe in yourself and try to be your best tomorrow.

is still fresh and the tracks of tanks and armored vehicles are still clear on the muddy road to Maarat al-Numan, the second-largest city in Idlib province, northwestern Syria.\n\nThe Syrian army captured the city recently, scoring an important victory against the rebel groups in their last major stronghold in Idlib and clearing part of the way toward securing the entire road connecting the capital Damascus in the south with Aleppo in the north.\n\nHowever, war is not an easy word, particularly for the ordinary people. Maarat al-Numan, now empty of its residents, has been deserted like a ghost town, silently telling a story of war.\n\nDuring a tour organized by the Syrian Information Ministry, reporters visited the city with the help of the Syrian army.\n\nScars of war was vividly seen in the city. The marketplace was empty of shopkeepers and shoppers but crowded with fighters and soldiers, who were breathing the sigh of relief after days of intense battles against the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front group.\n\nOn the walls, warmongering slogans from the rebels are penetrated with bullet holes.\n\nThere were houses without walls or ceilings, some buildings were stripped of both walls and roofs and left with staircases exposed to the open air.\n\nSome other buildings were pancaked and seemed to have succumbed to their damage and kneeled down to the ground.\n\nMuhammad Basmeh, a Syrian soldier, jammed his hands in his pocket from the cold wind and said he was happy to be able to take part in liberating the city from the rebel groups. He wished for a quick return of the residents to their homes.\n\nBasmeh himself had tasted the pain of displacement as his family had to flee the battles in the countryside of Latakia province in 2013, saying \"losing a home is one of the hardest things the Syrians endured during the crisis.\"\n\nIn the Sabaa Bahrat, the main square in Maarat al-Numan, a few big palm trees were still standing but the smaller ones were either broken or burnt during the battles. The square\'s fountain were dried up.\n\nThe famous statue of Abu Al-Alaa Al-Maarri, a historic Arab philosopher, poet and writer, disappeared from the square. The last time that the statue was seen was in a 2013 video by the radical rebels, who beheaded the statue, as al-Maarri was a critic of Islam in his days.\n\nThe mosaic painting museum, located near the square, is considered one of the most famous museums in the world as some of the paintings date back to the 5th century.\n\nSome of the paintings were completely destroyed, others were partially damaged while some others were still kept intact, telling the stories of hundreds of years ago.\n\nIt is not the only museum damaged during the war, as museums in Aleppo, Palmyra and Idlib were subject to the looting and smuggling of priceless artifacts.\n\nOn a radio device, an order was given to the soldiers to gather at the square in Maarat al-Numan with a military officer instructing them to prepare for the next battle that will take place in the city of Saraqeb in Idlib.\n\n\"The next target is capturing the city of Saraqeb, which is a key point on the official road linking Damascus with Aleppo,\" a military officer told Xinhua.\n\nThe officer started explaining to the reporters the battle plan on a map, saying that the Syrian army is advancing from two directions at once, one group is coming from Aleppo and the other from Idlib.\n\nThe officer said to the soldiers: \"you must be careful and the targeting must be precise to avoid any civilian casualty.\"\n\nThe officer wished the rebels will quickly surrender in Saraqeb to avert a grinding war in the area.\n\nHe repeated the government stance that \"the Syrian army will continue to fight until liberating all areas from the terrorist groups.\"\n\nOn the return of civilians to Maarat al-Numan, the officer said the city needs rehabilitation of its infrastructure, noting that this will start immediately after cleaning the city of mines and war leftovers.\n\nWafa Shabroni, a reporter working for RT, suffers major injuries in her face while covering the liberation of Maarat al-Numan when rebels\' ammunition exploded while she was nearby.\n\nShabroni was transferred to the Russian-run Hmeimim airbase in northwestern Syria and later to Moscow to receive treatment.\n\nMaarat al-Numan seems like an example of the Syrian war-hit regions, empty of residents, but left with scars of war and sound of shelling echoing from a distance.

The victory for the 23-year-old, her seventh China LPGA title and first win since 2015, was worth RMB315,000.\n\nSimilar to the history of the US Open where it took 17 years for an American-born player to win the tournament – players from England, Scotland and Jersey won the first 16 years – Lin became the first Chinese mainland winner since the championship debuted in 2006. Players from South Korea dominated the Women’s China Open for the first 11 years, while Lee Min (75) of Chinese Taipei won last year.\n\n“I am so proud that I can win my national Open in my home country, especially as I am only playing a couple of tournaments [in China] a year,” said Lin who is coming off a personal best season in the US where she made 19 of 23 cuts.\n\n“More importantly to myself, the last two years I have been through a really tough time. I lost my LPGA Tour card and my world ranking was probably the lowest ever. This has been a good year but I couldn’t think of a better result than winning a tournament to finish my season.”\n\nXiamen native Liu Yan finished runner-up for the second consecutive year when she closed with a 71. Feng Shanshan, the world No. 22 and top-ranked player in the field, was two shots further back after shooting 71 and finishing even-par for the tournament.\n\nGuangdong teenager Ren Yue (72) and Thai Kanphanitnan Muangkhumsakul (75) were equal fourth at five strokes back.\n\nLin, who goes by the name of ‘Janet’, started the day with a two shot lead and closed with a round that featured four birdies and four bogeys, including one at the last.\n\n“All week, if I put my real Janet hat on, I will say today I am not doing my best and I have so many things to be improving,” said Lin who struggled with her putting throughout the championship.\n\n“My weakness is still pretty obvious, but it’s winning the tournament that counts. It means I can handle it the best on the course no matter what happens. Overall, this is a really big week for me in the way I handle everything.”\n\nDetermined not to finish “runner-up again”, the 21-year-old Liu came out strong in front of her home crowd with consecutive birdies starting at the 364-yard first to get to three-under. She then went bogey-double bogey-bogey over the next three holes to drop to one-over. Four more birdies and a bogey at the last hole followed.\n\n“I had a great start and made two birdies in a row, but that double bogey was bad. It showed that I was inexperienced. Without that double I could have contended with Lin Xiyu. Those two dropped shots gave me a lesson, which might be a great thing for the future,” she said.\n\nFeng also started with consecutive birdies after starting five shots back. The China No. 1, however, could not mount a challenge in finishing with a round that included four birdies and three bogeys. The Guangdong great had nothing but praise for Lin.\n\n“It’s time for us to win the Women’s China Open. Congratulations to Xiyu who did great.

The signing of the Withdrawal Agreement, a legally binding international treaty, means these announcements are no longer valid.\n\nIn September, the British government announced that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would continue to fund the healthcare costs of Britons living abroad, mainly pensioners, who benefit from reciprocal healthcare arrangements for a maximum of six months, or 12 for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nPublic concerns have not been assuaged by the fact that some EU states have not updated their Brexit information online to take account of the Withdrawal Agreement, the Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nUnder the agreement, at the end of the transition period in December 2020, anyone with an existing British S1 reciprocal healthcare form will continue to have their healthcare costs met by the government, as long as they remain legally resident in their host country.\n\nAn S1 form will also entitle the holder to a \"UK European health insurance card\" for treatment when travelling within the EU.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and other Democrats have pressed for witnesses like former National Security Advisor John Bolton to be called to testify during the trial, while McConnell has argued against their demands.\n\nMcConnell has previously said that he wants to pass two resolutions, one at the outset of the trial about the rules, and the other passed after opening arguments and questions from senators, which would determine who will be called as witnesses, similar to the trial of former President Bill Clinton.\n\nWhite House Counsel Pat Cipollone is expected to lead Trump\'s defense, with the president\'s personal attorney Jay Sekulow at his side on the Senate floor, said a  report.\n\nTrump was alleged to have pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into launching investigations that could politically benefit him. Furthermore, the White House allegedly tried to cover it up after Pelosi initiated an impeachment inquiry in September.\n\nA whistleblower raised concerns about the White House\'s interactions with Ukraine in an anonymous complaint last summer. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, repeatedly calling the impeachment \"a hoax.\"\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House shall have the sole power of impeachment, while the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.\n\nConviction can only happen in the Senate and requires at least two-thirds of its members, or 67 senators, to vote in favor after a trial.

from some top athletes, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe believed that the 10-year-old Diamond League has to change to more appeal to the young audiences.\n\nLast month, World Athletics announced that Diamond League will no longer feature the 200m, 3,000m steeplechase, discus or triple jump at all of its meetings in 2020 season.\n\n\"10 years is a long time in the life of any product. Diamond league was 10 years old this year,\" said Coe last week in an exclusive interview with Xinhua in London. \"We looked at it and we thought, actually, it\'s a good product, but it can be better.\"\n\nCoe revealed that in some of the cities, the Diamond League meetings were not received well enough, especially by young people.\n\n\"The athletes weren\'t racing enough against each other. And there was less broadcast...And a lot of it was highlights packages. So clearly, it was our responsibility to make sure that we didn\'t continue to lose a market positioning,\" said Coe.\n\n\"And so in simple terms, they reduce the broadcast window to make sure that we have a faster, pacier event particularly for young people watching. Because these young people see the world in a very different way. We need to make sure that our fans of tomorrow are engaging with the sport,\" he said.\n\nAfter doing research on the popularity of the events, Diamond League decided to cut the length of meetings for a 90-minute broadcast window next season and four disciplines were axed from the core list so as not to show in the Final.\n\nThis decision inevitably drew criticisms from some elite athletes participating in those events but Coe said that no change could be universally popular.\n\n\"Every event will be judged at the end of the year for its popularity, for the amount of broadcast time, for the amount of interest for the social media. These are all the things that we will take into consideration. But it is really important that we changed.\"\n\nCoe said that Diamond League had run eight years without a sponsor, \"the second we started to talk about change and making it a faster pacier format, then we get a sponsor. And there\'s no coincidence in that\".\n\n\"We can\'t be a sport that is innately conservative, and not being prepared to embrace young and new audiences,\" said Coe.',1739242409),(721,'123',1,'Patient treatment, supplies highlighted in China\'s epidemic control meeting','2020-02-15 18:30:48','2020-02-15 18:30:48','BEIJING, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities emphasized the treatment of patients and the supply of medical resources at a high-level meeting on the novel coronavirus prevention and control on Wednesday.\n\nThe meeting, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, noted that the prevention and control efforts are in full swing and have been intensified, but the epidemic keeps spreading, with a rapid rising trend in some regions.\n\nThe situation remains grim and complex, according to the meeting of the leading group of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee on the prevention and control of the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus, with Li as the head.\n\nTargeted measures must be taken to curb the spread of the epidemic in the country, the meeting stressed, adding that further epidemic prevention and control should be carried out in central China\'s Hubei Province, and Wuhan, the provincial capital and center of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe meeting required dispersed clinical reception and centralized treatment, and severe patients should be sent to hospitals of best conditions or attended to by intensive-care experts.\n\nNoting that the development of vaccines should be sped up, the meeting also demanded to step up approval for medicines which initially proved effective in clinical research for extensive use as soon as possible.\n\nStressing all-out efforts to ensure the supply of medical resources, the meeting asked local administrations to organize enterprises to resume the production of resources including medical protective clothing, masks, and medicines.\n\nLocal authorities are required to guide logistic enterprises, including e-commerce entities, to smooth delivery, according to the meeting.\n\nThe supply of daily necessities and vegetables in key areas was emphasized at the meeting.\n\nThe meeting also stressed efforts of epidemic prevention and control amid the return trips of people after the Lunar New Year holiday, adding that proper postponement of return should be allowed.\n\nMethods such as ventilation and sterilization at public transportation vehicles, stations and ports should be implemented, it said.\n\nDelays in business operation and school opening should be applied, among other necessary measures, in Hubei Province and other places facing relatively serious epidemic.\n\nWang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and deputy head of the group, attended the meeting.',1398836387),(722,'123',1,'World Athletics president Coe welcomes China\'s running \"craze\"','2020-02-15 18:30:49','2020-02-15 18:30:49','LONDON, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- Sebastian Coe earned his fame by running on the track a few decades ago and now the World Athletics president is happy to see the running fever in China nowadays that indicates not only a big market but also a healthy lifestyle.\n\nFour years ago, Coe took office as the president of the international governing body of athletics after being elected during the 2015 Beijing World Athletics Championships.

Its per capita disposable income rose 5.8 percent to 30,733 yuan.\n\nFor China, this is a solid step toward the target of doubling its 2010 GDP by 2020, an important part of the nation\'s goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects for its 1.4 billion population.\n\nIt also serves to be a successful example of economic catching-up and inclusive growth, as the world watched the once economic backwater that could barely feed its own people becoming a major driving force of global economy.\n\nIn doing so, the nation has proved that a developing country with a huge population is capable of climbing up the ladder of development through structural reform, opening up and technological advancement.\n\nOf all the miracles, China\'s battle against poverty has been the most recent and strikingly encouraging story. Aiming to eradicate absolute poverty by 2020, the nation has already lifted over 800 million people out of poverty, representing over 70 percent of global poverty reduction.\n\nLikewise, China\'s GDP per capita passing the 10,000-dollar mark is also a major contribution to global development progress, which almost doubled the world\'s population enjoying such economic strength to nearly 3 billion, or more than 40 percent of the entire population on the planet.\n\nThe expansion in economic size also indicates a more influential role for China as a developing country on the global stage to reshape the world economic landscape and lead future growth.\n\nAfter remaining the strongest engine for global economic expansion since 2006, China\'s contribution to global economic growth last year is still expected to be around 30 percent in spite of slower growth.\n\nMeanwhile, as higher GDP per capita would translate into improved productivity and consumption power, a stable and open Chinese economy could mean more opportunities for the rest of the world.\n\nWith a 3.4-percent trade growth and total trade volume of over 31 trillion yuan, China has remained the world\'s biggest goods trading country in 2019. Moreover, China\'s ongoing urbanization and rapidly expanding consumer market are providing new possibilities for overseas investors.\n\nBuilding on the strong momentum, progress will continue to be made in areas such as structural reform, technological innovation, domestic demand expansion and improvement of people\'s well-being.

Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA,\" the watchdog concluded.\n\nOne day earlier, Lev Parnas, the indicted associate of Trump\'s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, told MSNBC of the role he played in the Ukraine pressure campaign, claiming \"President Trump knew exactly what was going on. He was aware of all my movements.\"\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said Thursday morning: \"These allegations are being made by a man who is currently out on bail for federal crimes and is desperate to reduce his exposure to prison.\"\n\n\"The facts haven\'t changed - the president did nothing wrong and this impeachment, which was manufactured and carried out by the Democrats has been a sham from the start,\" said Grisham.\n\n\n\n\"We are here today to cross a very important threshold in American history,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday as the Democrat-run House of Representatives voted to appoint and authorize seven managers for the Trump impeachment trial and to send two impeachment articles to the Senate.\n\n\"Here we go again, another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats,\" Trump tweeted earlier on the day.\n\nIt remains unclear if any witnesses will be called. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and other Democrats have pressed for witnesses like former National Security Advisor John Bolton to be called to testify during the trial, while McConnell has argued against their demands.\n\nMcConnell has previously said that he wants to pass two resolutions, one at the outset of the trial about the rules, and the other passed after opening arguments and questions from senators, which would determine who will be called as witnesses, similar to the trial of former President Bill Clinton.\n\nWhite House Counsel Pat Cipollone is expected to lead Trump\'s defense, with the president\'s personal attorney Jay Sekulow at his side on the Senate floor, said a  report.\n\nTrump was alleged to have pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into launching investigations that could politically benefit him. Furthermore, the White House allegedly tried to cover it up after Pelosi initiated an impeachment inquiry in September.\n\nA whistleblower raised concerns about the White House\'s interactions with Ukraine in an anonymous complaint last summer. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, repeatedly calling the impeachment \"a hoax.\"\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House shall have the sole power of impeachment, while the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.\n\nConviction can only happen in the Senate and requires at least two-thirds of its members, or 67 senators, to vote in favor after a trial.

However, given persistent policy uncertainty, weak business confidence and waning fiscal stimulus, GDP growth in the United States is forecast to slow from 2.2 percent in 2019 to 1.7 percent in 2020.\n\nIn the European Union, manufacturing will continue to be held back by global uncertainty, but this will be \"partially offset by steady growth in private consumption,\" allowing a modest rise in GDP growth from 1.4 percent in 2019 to 1.6 percent in 2020.\n\nDespite significant headwinds, East Asia remains the world\'s fastest growing region and \"the largest contributor to global growth,\" according to the report.\n\nIn China, GDP growth is projected to moderate gradually from 6.1 percent in 2019 to 6.0 percent in 2020 and 5.9 percent in 2021, supported by more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. Growth in other large emerging countries, including Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and Turkey, is expected to gain some momentum in 2020.\n\n\n\nProgress toward higher living standards has stalled for many, said the report.\n\nAfrica has experienced \"a decade of near stagnation\" in per capita GDP and many countries around the world are still ailing from the effects of the commodity price downturn of 2014-2016, which resulted in persistent output losses and setbacks in poverty reduction.\n\nIn one-third of commodity-dependent developing countries (home to 870 million people), average real incomes are lower today than they were in 2014. This includes several large countries such as Angola, Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.\n\nAt the same time, the number of people living in extreme poverty has risen in several sub-Saharan African countries and in parts of Latin America and Western Asia. Sustained progress toward poverty reduction will require both a significant boost to productivity growth and firm commitments to tackle high levels of inequality.\n\nUN estimates indicate that to eradicate poverty in much of Africa, annual per capita growth of over 8 percent would be needed, compared to the just 0.5 percent average rate over the past decade.\n\n\n\nHeadline GDP growth misses crucial aspects of sustainability and well-being, noted the report.\n\nBeyond GDP growth, other measures of well-being \"paint an even bleaker picture\" in several parts of the world. The climate crisis, persistently high inequalities, and rising levels of food insecurity and undernourishment continue to affect the quality of life in many societies.\n\n\"Policymakers should move beyond a narrow focus on merely promoting GDP growth, and instead aim to enhance well-being in all parts of society. This requires prioritizing investment in sustainable development projects to promote education, renewable energy, and resilient infrastructure,\" Elliott Harris, UN chief economist and assistant secretary-general for economic development, said at a press conference for the launch of the report.\n\nEconomic growth while limiting carbon emissions is possible by changing the energy mix, said the report.\n\nTo combat climate change, the world\'s growing energy needs must be met with renewable or low-carbon energy sources. This will require massive adjustments in the energy sector, which currently accounts for about three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions. If per capita emissions in developing countries were to rise toward those in developed economies, global carbon emissions would increase by more than 250 percent -- compared to the global goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe urgency of energy transition continues to be underestimated, resulting in short-sighted decisions such as expanding investment in oil and gas exploration and coal-fired power generation. This not only leaves many investors and governments exposed to sudden losses, but also \"poses substantial setbacks to environmental targets.\"\n\nAny delay in decisive action toward energy transition \"could double the eventual costs.\" The transition to a cleaner energy mix will bring not only environmental and health benefits, but economic opportunities for many countries, said the report.\n\n\n\n\"Overreliance on monetary policy\" is not just insufficient to revive growth; it also entails significant costs, including the exacerbation of financial stability risks. A more \"balanced policy mix\" is needed, one that stimulates economic growth while moving toward greater social inclusion, gender equality, and environmentally sustainable production.\n\n\"Amid growing discontent over a lack of inclusive growth, calls for change are widespread across the globe. Much greater attention needs to be paid to the distributional and environmental implications of policy measures,\" said Harris at the press conference.',582232936),(750,'123',1,'Australia captain Milligan retires from int\'l football','2020-02-15 18:31:24','2020-02-15 18:31:24','SYDNEY, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian national team captain Mark Milligan has announced that he will retire from international football on Monday, describing his 14-year-career with the Socceroos as a \"privilege\".\n\nTaking part in Australia\'s 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 World Cup campaigns, the crafty defensive midfielder said captaining the team over the past few years was \"an absolute honor and something I will treasure forever\".\n\nNow 34 years of age and plying his trade for Southend United in England\'s League One, Milligan made 80 appearances for his country and was a member of Australia\'s 2015 AFC Asian Cup-winning side.\n\n\"It hasn\'t always been smooth sailing - it was always going to be difficult to try to break into a squad full of Australian superstars,\" he said.\n\n\"But I was given a chance, and just to be involved with players from Australia\'s golden generation and learn my trade from them was an absolute gift that I will be forever grateful for.\"\n\n\"I was lucky to work under some wonderful coaches in my international career.\"\n\nFeaturing in the Chinese Super League for Shanghai Shenhua back 2009, Milligan has also played for club teams in Australia, Japan, Scotland, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nPlacing him among the very best players to have worn the green and gold, current Socceroos head coach Graham Arnold was full of praise for Milligan.\n\n\"I am so proud of Mark and the career that he has had,\" Arnold said.\n\n\"Mark\'s commitment and desire for Australian football is up there with the best and I feel privileged to have been involved with him at the start and end of his international career.\"\n\n\"Not many players can claim to have represented Australia at four World Cups, three Asian Cups, a Confederations Cup, as well as an Olympic Games.\"\n\n\"When you add in his tremendous club career, which includes two A-League Championships, a Premiership, and a Joe Marston Medal, it\'s clear that Mark\'s contribution to Australian football over a long period has been significant.\"',1261559723),(751,'123',1,'Interview: Myanmar, China good neighbors with cooperative relations, says top lawmaker','2020-02-15 18:31:25','2020-02-15 18:31:25','NAY PYI TAW, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and China are good neighbors sharing a long border line, and the two sides will develop their relations through stronger cooperation, Myanmar\'s top lawmaker has said.\n\nSpeaker of the Union Parliament and Speaker of the House of Representatives U T Khun Myat made the remarks in a recent interview with Xinhua ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping\'s upcoming visit to Myanmar.\n\n\"I am happy to know that Chinese President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to Myanmar at the invitation of Myanmar President U Win Myint,\" he said, adding that the Union Parliament welcomes Xi\'s visit.\n\n\"The visit of the Chinese president has a significant meaning.

All the peoples of the world are waking up,\" said Alibert.\n\nAlso on the fringes of the protest, Jean-Marc Cambo, civil servant at the departmental council of Seine-Saint-Denis just north of Paris, told Xinhua that \"with this reform, we do not have salary raises and no career perspectives -- the future seems blocked.\"\n\nAfter more than a month of protests against its retirement reform proposals, the French government decided on Jan. 11 to scrap from the draft legislation a pivot age of 64 years old.\n\nThe French Prime Minister, Edouard Philippe, reaffirmed the determination of his government, however, concerning the implementation of a universal retirement system as well as the elimination of special regimes.\n\nThis \"compromise\" is not calming the anger of the unions, nor is it making way for a truce in strike activity. After the pivot age was pulled, the CGT union continued to demand \"the withdrawal\" of the retirement reform. In a statement, the workers\' union said it was \"more determined than ever to obtain the withdrawal of the text.\"\n\n\n\nAfter several weeks of social unrest, the impact is starting to be felt in sectors as important as public transport, business or even tourism.\n\nThe SNCF (French national rail service) and the RATP (Paris public transport) have estimated losses of several million euros per day of strike. \"We will soon reach over 700 million euros of revenues lost, declared the president of the SNCF Jean-Pierre Farandu. At the RATP, the impact of the strikes is estimated at \"more than 150 million euros\" including \"60 to 90 million euros lost in ticketing.\"\n\nIn the sensitive sectors of commerce and hospitality, stakeholders have expressed their concerns since the first week of the conflict and have warned of the consequences of a potential prolongation of the movement.\n\nIn a survey conducted on Dec. 6-11 on the consequences of the social movement on very small and medium-sized businesses, the Confederation of small and medium businesses (CPME) said that 80 percent of the businesses are impacted either by losses in revenues, delays in deliveries, or by fuel shortages. The business sector is the most concerned by the recent events.\n\nA 20-25 percent drop in revenues was also observed in Paris by the Union of hospitality professions and industries, starting from the first week of the social movement against retirement reform. \"If the strikes continue, tourists will turn toward other destinations,\" had warned Jean-Marc Banquet, President of the Union of hospitality professions and industries.\n\nOn the political landscape, one of the stakes in the conflict is the struggle for public opinion. Despite the inconveniences (transport disruption, loss in business earnings, etc) linked to the strikes, public opinion continues to support the movement. According to the latest barometer conducted on Jan. 13 by Harris Interactive, 60 percent of French people say they support the movement in protest of the proposed retirement reforms.\n\nThe popularity of French President Emmanuel Macron has also taken a toll. In the latest YouGov poll held on Jan. 6-7, Macron\'s popularity dropped 4 points, with 25 percent favorable opinions, compared to 29 percent in December 2019.\n\nAccording to analysts, public opinion could end up being reflected at the polls in municipal elections next March.\n\n\n\nIn the eyes of certain experts and analysts, this social conflict reveals the faultlines in a political system which cannot resolve impasses or reconcile a fragmented society.\n\n\"The strike can be considered as a microcosm which reveals the vulnerability of the French economy and the institutional crisis of the country,\" said Zhao Junjie, a researcher at the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n\n\"Until now, the data on French economic growth seemed good, or at least better than the German data, but there remain many problems still, such as a relatively high unemployment rate, public debt, fragile budget balancing and a lack of innovation,\" indicated Zhao.\n\nAccording to official figures, spending for retirement pensions in France has represented 14 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), above that of all other European countries. If the government does not take measures, the potential deficit from pensions should reach 17 billion euros by 2025.\n\nMu Gengyuan, a researcher at the China Institute of International Studies, told Xinhua that \"the elevated spending for social security has provoked enormous budget deficits and represents financial unsustainability, which explains the absolute necessity for the retirement reforms.\"\n\nShe considers the coexistence of more than 40 types of retirement systems to be \"too complex\", which \"does not favor mobility of labor power and negatively affects social justice.\"\n\nIn addition, Mu denounced a growing disequilibrium in French society at the basis of the \"yellow vest\" movement and the strikes. \"Economic development has not benefited all citizens, while the gap between different social groups continues to deepen.\"\n\nFor French historian Maxime Tandonnet, cited by French daily Le Figaro, \"this shock translates the growing defiance of the population toward a ruling class perceived as being all the more haughty and arrogant as it fails in resolving problems (unemployment, poverty, violence, deficits, migration crisis, etc.).\"\n\nAccording to Zhao Junjie, the protest and the strike reflect \"an institutional crisis\" and \"a problem rooted in the capitalist system and in its political parties.\"\n\n\"France finds itself at a crucial stage in the reform. If the reform cannot advance, problems will only accumulate,\" concluded Zhao.

international relations, he said.\n\nThe state visit by President Xi on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties and his attendance with Myanmar leaders of the ceremony not only demonstrate the profound friendship between the two countries and peoples, but also make this year a new milestone in Myanmar-China relations, U Win Myint said, adding that the Myanmar side will

Myanmar have enjoyed friendly ties for thousands of years, Xi said, highlighting their profound friendship and the great tradition of sharing weal and woe.\n\nBoth Chinese and Myanmar cultures cherish the belief in a \"shared bond,\" he noted, explaining that the two countries are geographically linked, the peoples are connected by kinship and the cultures enjoy a natural affinity.\n\nThe millennia-old, time-tested \"Paukphaw\" (fraternal) friendship is as strong as ever and it has been the driving force and source of strength behind China-Myanmar relations, Xi said.\n\nHe encouraged the two sides to increase mutual learning and expand people-to-people exchanges through these celebration events, so as to engage more people in China and Myanmar to become stakeholders, beneficiaries and supporters of China-Myanmar friendship, thus cementing public support for their friendly ties.\n\nTo advance China-Myanmar relations in the new era, the Chinese president stressed that the two

overarching blueprint for future growth of bilateral ties.\"\n\nXi called on the two sides to follow the shared vision of a China-Myanmar community with a shared future, abide by the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and pursue stronger political trust, broader practical cooperation, so that the two peoples will forever be good neighbors, good friends, good \"Paukphaw\" and good partners.\n\nThe Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by China and Myanmar have made a major contribution to the history of international relations, Xi said.\n\nThe world today is undergoing deep changes not seen in a century, and countries are closely linked and are increasingly becoming a community with a shared future, Xi said.\n\nYet, the lack of equality and justice is still prominent in international relations, and to safeguard world peace and promote common development remains a challenging goal, he said.\n\nUnder new circumstances, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are more relevant than ever before, Xi stressed, saying that China and Myanmar, working together, can set an example for advocating and applying the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and be role models in the handling of state-to-state relations.\n\n\"Together, we can encourage all to join the efforts for building a community with a shared future for mankind,\" he said.\n\nQuoting Marshal Chen Yi, once China\'s foreign minister who wrote a poem in the 1960s comparing the China-Myanmar \"Paukphaw\" friendship to long flow of rivers, Xi said he is convinced that with joint efforts, the tide of China-Myanmar friendship and cooperation for common development will surge forward, like the Lancang and the Irrawaddy, coming from the same origin and rushing past mountains and

In a later conversation, one of Jihaoyeqiu\'s fellow ethnic Yi villagers said she used to believe that she was haunted by ghosts as she often fell sick.\n\nXi said in the past there were \"ghosts\" of poverty and backwardness.

Acting as a \"locomotive,\" it is expected to contribute to around 30 percent of global growth.\n\nEmerging from the 2010s larger and in better shape, the world\'s second-largest economy is increasingly shaped by the growing power of consumers and the services and emerging sectors, all believed to stimulate China\'s huge potential in market, reform and innovation.\n\nThese trends can offer glimpses into the positive changes the world can expect from China in the new decade:\n\n\n\nDomestic consumers now account for over 60 percent of China\'s economic growth. Despite a moderation of headline GDP growth, retail sales, a major gauge of consumption, grew 8 percent in 2019.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts expect the country\'s consumption to be shaped by a booming middle-income group, fast urbanization and technology advances, among other trends.\n\nWith the world\'s largest middle-income population, China has great potential to increase the contribution of consumption, especially that of services consumption, to its GDP growth, said Liu Qiao, dean of the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, predicting that services consumption would make up about 60 percent or more in China\'s total consumption by 2035.\n\nAlthough large cities still contributed to a larger amount of consumption, that of lower-tier cities and rural regions continued to grow fast. A report from Morgan Stanley predicted that consumption in China\'s smaller cities could triple by 2030 from 2018.\n\n\"The future Chinese consumers will be richer and more tech-savvy,\" said Asian market analyst Angela Moh in the report, \"Considering that by 2030, more than half of the population in China will either have grown up with a smartphone or be sufficiently tech-literate to benefit from the sprawling e-commerce, which is likely to remain a key driver of China\'s consumption.\"\n\n\n\nIn the 2020 Bloomberg innovation index, China ranked 15th on the list of the world\'s most innovative countries, rising from 16th in 2019 and 19th in 2018.

The proportion of China\'s clean energy sources in total energy consumption mix continued to rise to 24 percent of the total in 2019, up from 23 percent in 2018. Its carbon dioxide emissions per GDP dropped by 45.8 percent in 2018 from the 2005 level, a stride toward the goal of meeting the emission peak around 2030.\n\nThe country\'s green commitments can grow into enormous opportunities for global investors. Global financial giant Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) expects that China\'s efforts to meet the 2030 sustainable goals would bring about investment opportunities worth 3 trillion U.S. dollars, taking up about 30 percent of the total global investment value.\n\nRealizing the full coverage of clean water and sanitary facilities in China, for example, will unlock investment potential worth 26.1 billion U.S. dollars for the private sector, SCB noted.\n\n\n\nChina will continue to shorten the negative list to ease foreign investment off-limits rules and beef up opening-up efforts in pilot free trade zones in 2020, said the National Development and Reform Commission.\n\nWith the implementation of the landmark foreign investment law, removal of restrictions on the manufacturing and financial sectors for foreign firms and tariff cuts, China has quickened its opening-up pace.\n\nElectric carmaker giant Tesla witnessed China\'s speed as its Shanghai gigafactory delivered the first 15 Model 3 cars to customers less than one year after it began operation, which showed that China, with continued efforts in reform and opening-up, still tops the list of investment destinations for foreign firms.\n\nChina is committed to opening up at a higher level and honoring its promises to further open up its market, improve its opening-up structure, optimize the business environment, deepen multilateral and bilateral cooperation and advance Belt and Road cooperation.\n\nAs its door keeps opening wider and its economy expands steadily, China is bound to make greater contributions to the global economy.\n\n\"China will play a bigger role in fuelling global demand and supply,\" said Shao Yu, chief economist at Orient Securities.',1602818272),(853,'123',1,'UK, France reiterate commitment to upholding Iran nuclear deal','2020-02-15 18:33:31','2020-02-15 18:33:31','LONDON, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain and France on Sunday reaffirmed their commitment to the Iran nuclear deal while acknowledging the need to define a long-term framework to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, said a Downing Street spokesperson.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron made the remarks during a meeting on the margins of the Berlin conference on Libya.\n\n\"They agreed on the importance of de-escalation and of working with international partners to find a diplomatic way through the current tensions,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nFrance, Britain and Germany said Tuesday that they have triggered the dispute mechanism set up in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with the hope to preserve the nuclear deal and bring Iran back into full compliance with its commitments.\n\nIran, however, said its withdrawal from practical commitments under the JCPOA is a reaction to the U.S. exit from the deal in May 2018 and the subsequent sanctions, and also a response to Europe\'s sluggishness in facilitating Iran\'s banking transactions and its oil exports.\n\n\"Britain, France and Germany, three parties to the Iranian deal, claim that Europe has kept its obligations under JCPOA, however, in reality, they have not imported Iran\'s oil and have not facilitated Iran\'s international banking actions,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile on Libya, the spokesperson said Johnson and Macron also discussed the ongoing conflict in the war-torn country.\n\nJohnson stressed the need to bring an end to the fighting and for all parties to support peace talks to determine a way forward for the Libyan people, said the spokesperson.\n\nGathering envoys from the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China, among others, the Berlin conference on Libya was called after warring sides in Libya -- the UN-backed Government of National Accord and the Libyan National Army -- failed to reach a deal in Moscow.',695429422),(854,'123',1,'UN envoy to Yemen condemns Houthi missile attack on Marib\'s military camp','2020-02-15 18:33:32','2020-02-15 18:33:32','SANAA, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- The UN envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths on Sunday condemned a missile attack on a government military camp in the Yemeni northeastern province of Marib.\n\n\"Progress that Yemen has made on de-escalation is very fragile.

Isolationism and protectionism, as shown by the International Monetary Fund\'s repeated slashing of global growth forecasts, are only counterproductive.\n\nIn his speech addressing the 2017 edition of the WEF annual meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping compared the global economy to a big ocean from which no one can escape.\n\n\"Any attempt to cut off the flow of capital, technologies, products, industries and people between economies, and channel the waters in the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks is simply not possible. Indeed, it runs counter to the historical trend,\" he said.\n\nDespite the strong headwind of protectionism, free traders worldwide have in the past year made notable strides in promoting regional economic integration.\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area has been launched, 15 participating countries of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) have concluded text-based negotiations, and the European Union and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) have reached an agreement in principle on a free trade agreement. Those advancements have attested to Xi\'s judgement three years ago.\n\nSecondly, strengthening connective power by promoting practical cooperation worldwide can help bolster much needed economic development in the developing world so as to reduce global development deficits.\n\nLack of infrastructure remains a critical bottleneck for developing countries to deliver steady economic growth.\n\nTake the African continent as an example. According to an African Development Bank estimate, Africa\'s infrastructure needs are between 130 billion and 170 billion U.S. dollars per year, but there is a financing gap in the range of 68 billion and 108 billion dollars.\n\nChina has been a vigorous champion of boosting connectivity by helping developing countries build up infrastructure through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is aimed at infrastructure development and acceleration of economic integration of countries along and beyond the routes of the historic Silk Road.\n\nIf implemented fully, the initiative could lift 32 million people living on less than 3.2 U.S. dollars a day out of moderate poverty, a recent World Bank Group  on the BRI found.\n\nLast but not least, the international community needs to leverage a stronger connective power to tackle such non-traditional security challenges as climate change and terrorism that no single country, no matter how powerful it might be, can handle alone. There is no second option in this regard.\n\nWhen the ambitious Magellan was on the sea, he and his fellow sailors faced all sorts of hardships. But they always managed to charge forward because they knew they were right in the direction.\n\nToday, decisions-makers around the world, instead of being tempted to retreat to the past of isolation, should remain in the same spirit as that of Magellan and his seamen, and harness the connective power to heal this dividing world and build a cohesive and more prosperous global community.',522826871),(882,'123',1,'1.87 mln daily entry, exit trips predicted for Spring Festival holiday','2020-02-15 18:34:06','2020-02-15 18:34:06','BEIJING, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming Spring Festival holiday will see a daily average of 1.87 million trips made by passengers through China\'s entry and exit frontier inspection stations, the National Immigration Administration (NIA) said Wednesday.\n\nThe figure will be 2 percent more than that for the same period last year, the administration said.\n\nIt said the average daily tourist flow at major airports in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu is expected to reach 77,000, 116,000, 56,000 and 22,000, respectively.\n\nIt anticipates that Gongbei Port linking the mainland and Macao will see a notable increase with an average of 409,000 inbound and outbound trips each day, up 14 percent from last year.\n\nThe tourist flow at the ports connecting the mainland and Hong Kong will slightly decline, said the NIA.\n\nThe NIA asked border inspection agencies nationwide to disclose information on passenger flows in a timely manner and ensure safety and order.\n\nThe Spring Festival, or the Chinese Lunar New Year, falls on Jan. 25 this year.',687240717),(883,'123',1,'Bayern crush Bremen 6-1 in Bundesliga','2020-02-15 18:34:07','2020-02-15 18:34:07','BERLIN, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- Bayern Munich came from behind and Philippe Coutinho provided a hattrick at their 6-1 win over Werder Bremen in the 15th round of Bundesliga on Saturday.\n\nBayern\'s two-game losing streak came to an end as Coutinho donated two assists and three goals to secure a comeback victory against Bremen, who suffered their second defeat in row.\n\nThe defending champions grabbed the reins from the kickoff but neither Robert Lewandowski nor Serge Gnabry was able to overcome Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka in the opening stages.\n\nThe opener was scored at the other end of the pitch as Milot Rashica shrugged off Bayern defender Jerome Boateng before hammering the ball into the top right corner in the 24th minute.\n\nHansi Flick\'s men were shocked but recovered shortly before the half time as Coutinho tapped home Gnabry\'s square pass to the far post before Lewandowski benefitted on Coutinho\'s chipped through ball to beat Pavlenka in the added time of the first half.\n\nThe German record champions piled on the pressure after the restart and doubled their advantage in the 63rd minute when David Alaba\'s lob over Bremen\'s defence allowed Coutinho to chip the ball over onrushing Pavlenka.\n\nWerder Bremen were unable to respond and to hold the pace whereas the hosts continued on the front foot as Lewandowski slotted home Thomas Muller\'s good work to wrap up his brace in the 72nd minute.\n\nMuller got his name on the scoreboards as well after poking home Coutinho\'s assist moments later.

Xi congratulated them on their collective rise out of poverty, encouraging them to create an even better future.\n\nDulong people have now all moved into newly built houses, and all of the six administrative villages have access to paved roads, 4G and radio and TV signals.\n\nThe list of ethnic minority groups shaking off absolute poverty will continue to grow. However, eliminating poverty is not the end of the story. Giving people of all ethnic groups the chance to have a good life is the goal of China\'s drive for a xiaokang society.\n\nThat is why Xi, during his tour, said it is necessary to comprehensively promote rural vitalization. He called for efforts to develop rural industries, improve the rural economy, increase incomes and improve people\'s wellbeing.\n\nA moderately prosperous society in an all-around way requires innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development for high-quality growth.\n\nEcological protection is definitely included in the agenda. As part of his Yunnan tour, Xi went to the provincial capital of Kunming to inspect the protection of Dianchi Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Yunnan and once one of the most severely polluted lakes in China. Thanks to a relentless treatment over the past few years, the ecological environment has been greatly improved.\n\nBuilding a well-off society also requires enhanced efforts of opening up. Yunnan, once a border province isolated by mountains and rivers, is standing at the frontline of the cooperation with South Asian and Southeast Asian countries. Benefiting from enhanced connectivity with neighboring countries, the province will better open up through the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nXi\'s tour was far more than a trip. His instructions during the tour will serve as guidance for the central and local governments to complete building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and do more after the goal is achieved.\n\nThe building of a modernized economic system should be stepped up. Supply-side structural reform, the development of the real economy, the upgrading of the manufacturing industry, the overhaul of the tourism industry, infrastructure building, agricultural production, ecological protection, and opening up all need to be accelerated. Ethnic solidarity, the work of religious affairs and cracking down on cross-border crimes also bear great significance to the people\'s wellbeing.\n\nThe tasks at hand are daunting, but the government will complete them nevertheless, because establishing a xiaokang society by 2020 is a promise China is determined to keep, through real actions, with concrete results.\n\nThe Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls on Jan. 25, is the most important festival on the Chinese calendar.
